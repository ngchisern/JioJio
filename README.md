## Introduction

Have you ever felt dispirited to cancel your plans because there are not enough participants? We believe that almost everyone has a similar experience. Perhaps, you and your current circle of friends do not have similar interests. Or, your schedules just do not coincide. 

Hence, it would be nice to have a platform to invite each other out to an event for those who do not mind meeting new people. Not only that we can have a higher chance of pursuing our interests or hobbies, but we can also expand our social circle along the way.

## Aim

We hope to develop an application to facilitate people to pursue their interests, discover other hobbies, and make new friends through meaningful events.  With this application, we also aspire to encourage users to find like-minded people and form lasting connections.
